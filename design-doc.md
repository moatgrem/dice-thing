<h1>Ideas for the dice-thing.</h1>
<p> I'm gonna be using this to refer for planned features / additions for the first iteration of the dice-thing.      </p>

<h2>Needed / First iteration must-haves.</h2>
<p>
Physical screen.<br>
Battery-driven.<br>
Able to be modified code-wise.<br>
Optimized battery-life (Hardware and software-wise.) <br>
Rechargable via {I don't know.}.<br>
Non-self combusting.<br>
3D-printed chassis.<br>
Accelerometer. <br>
Compact. <br>
Basic UI / info. <br>
Robust. ( Can fall off a table or three without exploding.) <br>
Vibration function.<br>

  
</p>

<h2>Nice to have</h2>
<p>
  Small speaker / piezo buzzer.<br>
  Bigger screen. <br>
  Touch-screen.  <br>
  More advanced UI. <br>
  </p>
  
<h2>Future improvements.</h2>

  <p>
  Adaptive to played boardgame from selectable menu on dice. Also allow scorekeeping / tallykeeping, or as a reminder for important mechanics / timers.<br> <br>
  Smaller version for ease of carrying, but can be combined with another of the same size using pogo-pins to "start" a roll-off. These could also be "linked" to a bigger dice-thing, as a way for each player to have a small device for looking up faction specific stuff and to see whose turn it is.<br> 
  <br>
  Custom PCB ( If I'm rich. ) for smaller footprint and designs.
