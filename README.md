Repository for personal project creating a physical dice running (Python?) on a microcontroller (ESP32?), for use in real life boardgames.
This dice includes a screen for automatic rolling by either shaking the dice or using the touch display.

Eventually want to update it to allow game setups for different board game systems, where a setup / faction etc... can be automatically rolled for / decided for players, and from there this data can also be used for the dice rolls to include modifiers.

Please don't bully me too hard.
I suck shit at coding and i'm doing this for fun. ( I think. )
